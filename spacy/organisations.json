The Patient Also Has Some Pain In The Left Knee As Well. The Patient Has Recently Received Right Knee Prp Injection Which Has Caused About A 20-30% Improvement Which Is Progressively Getting Better And The Patient Has Also Seen Spinal Surgeon And Has Been Deemed Surgical At C4-5 For Anterior Cervical Discectomy And Fusion. The Patient Has Been Having Significant Pain That Has Been Radiating Out Over The Upper Trapezii Into The Shoulders But The Patient Does Not Have Any Pain In The Shoulders When Moving And This Makes Me Think That C4-5 Disc Injury Is Giving The Patient Symptomatology In A 05 Distribution Which Is Encompassing The Shoulders. The Lower Back Is Definitely Feeling Better. The Patient Is Concerned At This Time About The Left Knee Which At Some Point In Time May Need To Be Addressed But I Want To See If The Injections For The Right Knee Are Helping The Patient And Are Going To Give Improvement And Then We Will Continue To Work This Patient Up And Look At The Left Knee But In The Meantime, The Patient Is Likely Going To Be Getting Cervical Spine Surgery For The Persistent Cervical Spine Pathology And The Disc Pathology Which Does Warrant The Surgical Consideration That Has Been Given. Other Than This, There Are No Radiating Lower Extremity Complaints, Ataxia, Bowel Or Bladder Loss, Or Proprioceptive Changes. The Headaches Are Still Present But There Are No Neurocognitive Changes, Prodrome, Or Aura And There Is No Symptomatology Radiating Down Further Into The Distal Upper Extremities Other Than At The Shoulder Area. There Are No Changes From The Last Visit Regarding Patient Medications, Allergies, Past Medical History, Past Surgical History, Hospitalizations, Family History, Social History Or Review Of Systems. Objective: Vital Signs: Height 5'1\", Weight 142 Lbs, Blood Pressure 120/90, Pulse 74, Respirations 16. General: The Patient Upon General Observation Has No Findings Currently Of Loss In Muscle Size, Shape Or Tone In The Upper Or Lower Extremities Or The Midline. There Are No Signs Of Tremor Or Fesciculations. The Patient Does Have Some Mild Gait Alteration At Times Secondary To Knee Pain, The Patient Is Wearing A Right Knee Brace Today But Overall, She Does Feel More Comfort In The Right Knee. There Is Normal Behavior For The Patient Given Circumstances And Memory Recall, Conversational Skills, Attention And Gross Cognition All Appear To Be Intact. The Patient Is Completely Responsive And Oriented As To Person, Place And Time. Orthopedic: Palpable Tenderness: There Is Still Tenderness In The Suboccipital Region And Diffusely Throughout The Cervical Spine. There Is No Skull, Tmj, Or Anterior Cervical Tenderness. There Is Lumbar Tenderness That Is Not As Significant As The Neck. In The Right Knee, There Is Still Tenderness Over The Lateral Compartment And Retropatellar Area, There Are Also Minimal Findings Similar To That In The Left Knee Which The Patient Is Becoming More Acutely Aware Of.
